# Challenge - Sing-along

## The Task

1. Parse the provided String (`song`) and create an array with
   an entry for each line of the song.
   Eg: (`["Baby Shark doo doo doo doo doo doo", "Baby Shark!"]`)
2. Render each line of that array to the DOM as an `<li>`
   within the `#lyrics-list` unordered list.
3. Display each array item to the page sequentially, at
   1.5 second intervals
