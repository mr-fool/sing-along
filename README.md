# Challenge - Sing-along

## The Task

1. Parse the provided String (`song`) and create an array with
   an entry for each line of the song.
   Eg: (`["Baby Shark doo doo doo doo doo doo", "Baby Shark!"]`)
2. Render each line of that array to the DOM as an `<li>`
   within the `#lyrics-list` unordered list.
3. Display each array item to the page sequentially, at
   1.5 second intervals

Inspiration

-This article inspired me from a technical perspective because it addresses one of the biggest challenge of smart contract and dApps-updating and maintainability. The article it provides another approach other than the traditional "kill" switch in a smart contract and dApps


Focus


-If I were given the time and resources to build/learn anything I wanted during my internship, I would choose to focus on progressive web apps. I would spend half of the time surveying what the users want. I believe that the user's input will play significant role in the implementations.
